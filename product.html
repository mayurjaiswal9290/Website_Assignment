                people
                are opting for a home automation system. By automating your home, you can save electricity, remotely
                monitor and control your appliances, and make your home safer for your disabled or elderly family
                members. <br>
                Now no more worrying about your appliances when you go on a vacation; the smart home automation
                system will alert you if you’ve forgotten to switch off anything, and you can remotely control them
                through the smart switchboard. All you need to do is download the app on your Smartphone, or track it
                over the net on your computer. <br>
                Electrical short circuit started a fire? No problem! sensors will detect the smoke and
                immediately send you alerts so you can take action and keep your home safe. Integrate your home security
                system with home automation system and conduct remote surveillance of your home whenever you’re
                away.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> In this IoT product, I have made the Home Automation system
                using the NodeMCU ESP8266 D1 mini & 8 Relay Module. You can easily control light, fan, and other home
                appliances.
                with the voice command. To connect the Echo Dot smart speaker and google assistant with the NodeMCU. <br>
                We need custom design PCB to make this smart home system. therefore to make the circuit
                compact and to give the project a professional look, I have designed the PCB for the product as you can
                see the image.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Sensors and Microcontrolor</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A microcontroller is an integrated circuit (IC) device used for
                controlling other portions of an electronic system, usually via a microprocessor unit (MPU), memory, and
                some peripherals. These devices are optimized for embedded applications that require both processing
                functionality and agile, responsive interaction with digital, analog, or electromechanical components.
                <br>
                There are numerous definitions as to what a sensor is but I would like to define a Sensor as an input
                device which provides an output (signal) with respect to a specific physical quantity (input).
                The term “input device” in the definition of a Sensor means that it is part of a bigger system which
                provides input to a main control system (like a Processor or a Microcontroller).

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Internet of Things</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> ‘Internet of Things’ is an umbrella term used for all technologies that
                enable the connection of a device to the Internet. <br>

                Such systems depend on the collection of data. The data is then used for monitoring, controlling and
                transferring information to other devices via the internet. This allows specific actions to be
                automatically activated whenever certain situations arise. <br>

                Now apply the same concept to the entire home and all the devices present. That is a smart home powered
                by IoT. Instead of manually going up to the device and taking action, those actions can be taken at the
                press of a button.
